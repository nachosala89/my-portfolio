# My Portfolio

> This project is proposed by Microverse to prepare our professional portfolio from the first week. For this first stage, I implemented the design for the main page of the mobile version. The design was obtained from [this Sigma template](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=1%3A1471). The main layout model used for this project is Flexbox.
